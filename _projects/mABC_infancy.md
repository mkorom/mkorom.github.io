The project focuses on the effects of ABC during the first year of life. Infants were exposed to opioids during pregnancy and mothers were receiving the modified version of ABC while receiving medication assisted treatment. Infants were scanned at 6 and 12 months of age and data analysis is currently ongoing. resting-state fMRI, diffusion, and T1- and T2-weighted scans were collected.
