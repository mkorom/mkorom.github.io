The project involves children from families who are involved with Child Protective Services (CPS) are at greater risk for developing problems related to their socio-emotional, cognitive, and brain development. In efforts to improve these childrenâ€™s developmental outcomes, we assessed the efficacy of ABC among parents with CPS. Parents were randomly assigned to either receive ABC or to receive a control intervention of the same duration and frequency. We then followed up with the families when children were ages 8, 9 and 10.

Key findings:

    1. Children in the ABC group show more age-typical (near-zero) amygdala-OFC resting-state
    functional connectivity as compared to the control group (manuscript under review). The
    control intervention showed a negative functional connectivity.

    2. Children in the ABC group showed greater prefrontal cortex activation in response to
    photographs of fearful faces compared to children in the control group. This suggests
    that ABC children had better regulation to threat at the level of brain activation
    (see Valadez et al., 2023).

     3. ABC intervention improves inhibitory control at age 10 (see Korom et al., 2021).
     Specifically, children who received ABC during early childhood showed faster reaction
     time on the Stop Signal Reaction Time paradigm as compared to the control
     intervention group. No statistically significant effect emerged between the ABC and
     the low-risk comparison group.
