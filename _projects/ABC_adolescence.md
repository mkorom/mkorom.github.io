The project focuses on children from families involved with Child Protective Services (CPS), who are at heightened risk for socio-emotional, cognitive, and brain development issues. To improve these children's developmental outcomes, we evaluated the efficacy of the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention with parents involved in CPS. Parents were randomly assigned to either receive ABC or a control intervention of equivalent duration and frequency. Follow-up assessments were conducted when the children reached ages 8, 9, and 10.

Key findings:

    1. Children in the ABC and low-risk (community) comparison group demonstrated age-typical (near-zero) amygdala-OFC resting-state functional connectivity compared to the control intervention group (Korom, Valadez, Tottenham, Dozier, & Spielberg, 2025). In contrast, the control intervention group showed a negative functional connectivity.

    2. Children in the ABC group showed greater prefrontal cortex, ACC, and insula activation in response to photographs of fearful and neutral faces compared to children in the control intervention group. Furthermore, amygdala showed a stronger negative functional connectivity with areas of the lateral frontal cortex and insula, suggesting that ABC is causally lined to enhanced neurobiological regulation in the ABC group as compared to the control intervention group (see Valadez et al., 2023).

     3. ABC intervention improves inhibitory control at age 8 (see Korom et al., 2021).
     Specifically, children who received ABC during early childhood showed faster reaction
     time on the Stop Signal Reaction Time paradigm as compared to the control
     intervention group. No statistically significant effect emerged between the ABC and
     the low-risk comparison groups.
