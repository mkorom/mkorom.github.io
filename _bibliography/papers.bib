  abstract = "Polyvictimization, exposure to multiple potentially traumatic events (PTEs), is prevalent and has profound mental health implications. Investigating the patterns and impact of co-occurring PTEs during childhood is essential to design and deliver tailored clinical services. This study included a diverse community sample of 326 youth (ages 7–16). Latent class analysis (LCA) of DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criterion A events was conducted to identify PTE classes. Classes were further characterized using race-related, peer, and dating victimization, and psychopathology symptoms (PTSD, anxiety, depression). Three classes emerged: (1) low trauma, (2) interpersonal and community violence (IPV/CV), and (3) emotional abuse, neglect, and interpersonal violence in familial relationships (EA/N/IPVFam). Demographics, total PTEs, age at first exposure, race-related events, PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms varied across classes, indicating functional significance of identified profiles. Results underscore the importance of considering PTE profiles and person-centered approaches to understand and address trauma-related sequelae in youth.",

However, the field has historically excluded people from global majority countries and from marginalized communities in FIT neuroimaging research. Inclusive and representative samples are essential for generalizing findings across neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and cranial ultrasonography. These FIT neuroimaging techniques pose unique and overlapping challenges to equitable representation in research through sampling bias, technical constraints, limited accessibility, and insufficient resources. The present article adds to the conversation around the need to improve inclusivity by highlighting modality-specific historical and current obstacles and ongoing initiatives.

Numerous risk factors have been linked to IDD, including biomedical and environmental influences. However, specific underlying etiology is not necessarily easily identified. Nongenetic pathways are dependent upon sensitive periods of neurodevelopment, including the perinatal period. In this chapter, we review nongenetic perinatal risk factors that influence fetal brain development and confer risk to later IDD diagnosis in childhood. Following this, we outline factors that mitigate risk for future offspring development of IDD.

Families were referred to the study by Child Protective Services (CPS) as part of a diversion from a foster care program. A low-risk group of families was also recruited. CPS-involved families were randomly assigned to receive the target (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up, ABC) or a control intervention (Developmental Education for Families, DEF) before infants turned 2. Both interventions were home-based, manualized, and 10-sessions long. During middle childhood, children underwent a 6-min resting-state functional MRI scan. Amygdala seed-based rs-fc analysis was completed with intervention group as the group-level predictor of interest. Fifty-seven children (NABC = 21; NDEF = 17; NCOMP = 19; Mage = 10.02 years, range = 8.08–12.14) were scanned successfully. The DEF group evidenced negative left amygdala↔OFC connectivity, whereas connectivity was near zero in the ABC and comparison groups (ABCvsDEF: Cohen’s d = 1.17). ABC may enhance high-risk children’s regulatory neurobiology outcomes ∼8 years after the intervention was completed.},

abstract = {Given that human infants are almost fully reliant on caregivers for survival, the presence of parents who provide sensitive, responsive care support infants and young children in developing the foundation for optimal biological functioning. Conversely, when parents are unavailable or insensitive, there are consequences for infants' and children's attachment and neurobiological development. In this paper, we describe effects of inadequate parenting on children's neurobiological and behavioral development, with a focus on developing capacities for executive functioning, emotion regulation, and other important cognitive-affective processes. Most prior research has examined correlational associations among these constructs. Given that interventions tested through randomized clinical trials allow for causal inferences, we review longitudinal intervention effects on children's biobehavioral and cognitive-affective outcomes. In particular, we provide an overview of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a study in which children were randomized to continue in orphanage care (typically the most extreme condition of privation) or were placed into the homes of trained, supported foster parents. We also discuss findings regarding Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up, an intervention enhancing sensitivity among high-risk parents. We conclude by suggesting future directions for research in this area.},

The aim of the present study was to explore the brain morphological (cortical thickness and surface area) correlates of A/D symptoms and the extent to which these phenotypes vary depending on the quality of the parenting context in which children develop. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired on 45 children with Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement due to risk of not receiving adequate care (high-risk group) and 25 children without CPS involvement (low-risk group) (rangeage = 8.08-12.14; Mage = 10.05) to assess cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (SA). A/D symptoms were measured using the Child Behavioral Checklist. The association between A/D symptoms and CT, but not SA, differed by risk status such that high-risk children showed decreasing CT as A/D scores increased, whereas low-risk children showed increasing CT as A/D scores increased. This interaction was specific to CT in prefrontal, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortical regions. The groups had marginally different A/D scores, in the direction of higher risk being associated with lower A/D scores. Results suggest that CT correlates of A/D symptoms are differentially shaped by the quality of early caregiving experiences and should be distinguished between high- and low-risk children.},

abstract = {Art exposure can influence children's emotional growth, but little is known about tools that aid emotional development in art museums. We implemented attentional and social manipulations to test whether (1) modifications to unscripted instructions and (2) caregiver prompts shape children's attentional focus towards either the emotional or elemental content (e.g., colour and medium) of paintings. These manipulations occurred within an on-going art museum education programme. Afterwards, children's (N = 60; ages 3–13 years) attentional focus towards emotions or elements was assessed by asking them to select words that best described the art. Children focused on emotion more, but the instructional manipulation successfully influenced word choices towards the targeted focus. Caregiver prompts also influenced focus towards the elements and away from emotions. These findings highlight that children's attention to art's emotional content can be altered by social context, which here was demonstrated within a museum programme.},

abstract = {Positive associations have been found between cortical thickness and measures of parasympathetic cardiac control (e.g., respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) in adults, which may indicate mechanistic integration between neural and physiological indicators of stress regulation. However, it is unknown when in development this brain–body association arises and whether the direction of association and neuroanatomical localization vary across development. To investigate this, we collected structural magnetic resonance imaging and resting-state respiratory sinus arrhythmia data from children in middle childhood (N = 62, Mage = 10.09, range: 8.28–12.14 years). Whole-brain and exploratory ROI analyses revealed positive associations between RSA and cortical thickness in four frontal and parietal clusters in the left hemisphere and one cluster in the right. Exploratory ROI analyses revealed a similar positive association between cortical thickness and RSA, with two regions surviving multiple comparison correction, including the inferior frontal orbital gyrus and the Sylvian fissure. Prior work has identified these cortical areas as part of the central autonomic network that supports integrative regulation of stress response (e.g., autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral) and emotional expression. Our results suggest that the association between cortical thickness and resting RSA is present in middle childhood and is similar to the associations seen during adulthood. Future studies should investigate associations between RSA and cortical thickness among young children and adolescents.},

Treatments for these conditions must be optimized through mechanistic understanding from rigorous and replicable research. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can visualize and quantify brain structure and function throughout development. MRI is safe and noninvasive and can provide quantitative measurements of brain growth and matu- ration at high spatial resolution. Thus, MRI is a powerful and flexible tool for characterizing neurodevelopment. An impediment to characterizing neurodevelopmental in- sights from MRI comes from the unique challenges of con- ducting MRI in children, particularly those younger than 3 years of age. In this commentary, we highlight that acquiring high- quality MRI data in young children is a science in and of itself— though it may feel more like an art than a science to those newer to the field.

@article{Valadez2023a,
abstract = {Objective: Early adverse parenting predicts various negative outcomes, including psychopathology and altered development. Animal work suggests that adverse parenting might change amygdala–prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuitry, but work in humans remains correlational. The present study leveraged data from a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of an early parenting intervention targeting parental nurturance and sensitivity (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up [ABC]) to test whether early parenting quality causally affects amygdala-PFC connectivity later in life. Method: Participants (N = 60, mean age = 10.0 years) included 41 high-risk children whose parents were referred by Child Protective Services and randomly assigned to receive either ABC (n = 21) or a control intervention (n = 20) during the children's infancy and a comparison sample of low-risk children (n = 19). Amygdala-PFC connectivity was assessed via functional magnetic resonance imaging while children viewed fearful and neutral faces. Results: Across facial expressions, ABC produced different changes than the control intervention in amygdala-PFC connectivity in response to faces. The ABC group also exhibited greater responses than the control intervention group to faces in areas classically associated with emotion regulation, including the orbitofrontal cortex and right insula. Mediation analysis suggested that the effect of ABC on PFC activation was mediated by the intervention's effect on amygdala-PFC connectivity. Conclusion: Results provide preliminary causal evidence for the effect of early parenting intervention on amygdala-PFC connectivity and on PFC responses to face viewing. Findings also highlight amygdala-PFC connectivity as a potential mediator of the effects of early parenting intervention on children's emotion regulation development.

abstract = {Although decades of research have shown associations between early caregiving adversity, stress physiology and limbic brain volume (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus), the developmental trajectories of these phenotypes are not well characterized. In the current study, we used an accelerated longitudinal design to assess the development of stress physiology, amygdala, and hippocampal volume following early institutional care. Previously Institutionalized (PI; N = 93) and comparison (COMP; N = 161) youth (ages 4–20 years old) completed 1–3 waves of data collection, each spaced approximately 2 years apart, for diurnal cortisol (N = 239) and structural MRI (N = 156). We observed a developmental shift in morning cortisol in the PI group, with blunted levels in childhood and heightened levels in late adolescence. PI history was associated with reduced hippocampal volume and reduced growth rate of the amygdala, resulting in smaller volumes by adolescence. Amygdala and hippocampal volumes were also prospectively associated with future morning cortisol in both groups. These results indicate that adversity-related physiological and neural phenotypes are not stationary during development but instead exhibit dynamic and interdependent changes from early childhood to early adulthood.},

abstract = {Children at risk for neglect or abuse are vulnerable to delays in inhibitory control development. Prior findings suggest that early parenting interventions that target parental sensitivity and responsiveness during infancy can improve executive function outcomes of high‐risk children during preschool years; however, little is known about how persistent these gains are through middle childhood. Participants included 76 CPS‐involved children who were randomly assigned to either the ABC intervention ( N = 32) or the Developmental Education for Families (DEF) control intervention ( N = 44), and 53 low‐risk children. Children completed the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) paradigm at ages 8 and 10. Intervention group predicted performance on the SSRT at age 8 such that children who received the ABC intervention and children in the low‐risk group performed significantly better than children who received the DEF intervention (ABC vs. DEF: Cohen's d = 0.92; low‐risk group vs. DEF: d = 0.56). The performances of the ABC and the low‐risk groups were not statistically different. There were no significant group differences in SSRT performance at age 10. These findings demonstrate that the ABC intervention has long‐term beneficial effects on inhibitory control development in children with a history of early caregiving adversity.

abstract = {The field of fetal, infant, and toddler (FIT) neuroimaging research—including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, among others—offers pioneering insights into early brain development and has grown in popularity over the past 2 decades. In broader neuroimaging research, multisite collaborative projects, data sharing, and open-source code have increasingly become the norm, fostering big data, consensus standards, and rapid knowledge transfer and development. Given the aforementioned benefits, along with recent initiatives from funding agencies to support multisite and multimodal FIT neuroimaging studies, the FIT field now has the opportunity to establish sustainable, collaborative, and open science practices. By combining data and resources, we can tackle the most pressing issues of the FIT field, including small effect sizes, replicability problems, generalizability issues, and the lack of field standards for data collection, processing, and analysis—together. Thus, the goals of this commentary are to highlight some of the potential barriers that have waylaid these efforts and to discuss the emerging solutions that have the potential to revolutionize how we work together to study the developing brain early in life.},
