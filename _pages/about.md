Marta is a post-doctoral fellow at the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/sdan), where she is mentored by Dr. Katharina Kircanski (currently at USC) and Dr. Daniel Pine. At NIMH, Marta investigates the neurobiological and interpersonal risk and resilience factors that influence internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as well as the effects of evidence-based interventions on brain development in depressed and/or anxious adolescents. She employs structural and functional MRI, EEG, eye-tracking, and behavioral measures to better understand mechanisms of change.

Marta completed her doctoral training in clinical science at the [University of Delaware](https://www.psych.udel.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/clinical-science) and her clinical internship at the [Medical University of South Carolina](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/psychiatry/education/clinical-psychology) in 2024, where she gained extensive experience in trauma-informed, evidence-based interventions.

During her graduate training at UD in Dr. Mary Dozier’s [ABC lab](https://www.abcintervention.org/), Marta focused on the short- and long-term effects of enhanced parenting on the neural, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological health of maltreated infants and adolescents. Prior to her time at UD, Marta earned her BA in Human Behavior Analysis in 2012 and her MA in Clinical and Health Psychology in 2015 from the [University of Szeged, Hungary](https://u-szeged.hu/english). She also completed a master’s program in Personality and Psychopathology at [Teachers College, Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/counseling-and-clinical-psychology/clinical/degrees--requirements/psychology-in-education-general-track-ma/) in 2018. While at Columbia, Marta worked in Dr. Nim Tottenham’s lab, studying the effects of early severe neglect on children’s brain development.
