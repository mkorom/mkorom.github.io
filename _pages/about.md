Marta is a doctoral candidate in the clinical science program at the [University of Delaware](https://www.psych.udel.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/clinical-science). She is currently on internship at the [Medical University of South Carolina](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/psychiatry/education/clinical-psychology) where she specializes in Trauma-Focused CBT.

Marta received her master's degrees at the [University of Szeged, Hungary](https://u-szeged.hu/english) in Clinical and Health Psychology and in Personality and Psychopathology at [Teachers College, Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/counseling-and-clinical-psychology/clinical/degrees--requirements/psychology-in-education-general-track-ma/). During her studies at Columbia, Marta worked in Dr. Nim Tottenham's lab, studying the effects of early severe neglect on lifelong structural brain development.

Marta joined Dr. Mary Dozier's [ABC lab](https://www.abcintervention.org/) for her graduate studies. Her graduate research has focused on the short- and long-term effects of enhanced parenting on the neural, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological outcomes of adversity-exposed infants and adolescents. Marta uses structural and functional MRI, hormonal assays, and behavioral methods to understand how parenting interventions can promote resilience following early insensitive care.

For her post-doctoral training, Marta will be joining Dr. Katharina Kircanski and Dr. Daniel Pine's work at [NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/sdan), where she'll study the effects of the Unified Protocol on the brain development of depressed adolescents. Furthermore, she'll use TMS to tackle the issue of treatment resistant depression in adolescents.
