Marta is a doctoral candidate in the clinical science program at the `University of Delaware (UD)`. She is in the process of completing her clinical internship at the [Medical University of South Carolina (Traumatic Stress track)]( (https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/psychiatry/education/clinical-psychology) where she specializes in Trauma-Focused CBT.

Before her graduate studies at UD, Marta received her master's degree at the University of Szeged, Hungary in Clinical and Health Psychology, and another master's degree in Personality and Psychopathology at Teachers College, Columbia University in the City of New York. During her years at Columbia, Marta worked in Dr. Nim Tottenhams's lab, studying the effects of early severe neglect on lifelong structural brain development.

Marta joined Dr. Mary Dozier's [ABC lab](https://www.abcintervention.org/) at UD for her graduate studies. Her graduate research has focused on the short- and long-term effects of enhanced parenting on the neural, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological (cortisol regulation) outcomes of adversity-exposed infants and adolescents. Marta uses structural and functional MRI (gross activation, network analysis), EEG, and behavioral methods to understand how parenting interventions can promote resilience among infants who were exposed to opioids in-utero and adolescents with a history of Child Protective Services involvement.

For her post-doctoral training, Marta will be joining Dr. Katharina Kircanski and Dr. Daniel Pine's work at [NIMH]( (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/sdan), where she'll study the effects of the Unified Protocol on the brain development of depressed adolescents. Furthermore, she'll use TMS to tackle the issue of treatment resistant depression in adolescent youth.
