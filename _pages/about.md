Marta completed her doctoral training in clinical science at the [University of Delaware](https://www.psych.udel.edu/graduate/areas-of-study/clinical-science) (UD) and her clinical internship at the [Medical University of South Carolina](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/psychiatry/education/clinical-psychology) in 2024, where she gained extensive training in trauma-informed evidence-based interventions.

Marta's graduate training at UD in Dr. Mary Dozier's [ABC lab](https://www.abcintervention.org/) focused on the short- and long-term effects of enhanced parenting on the neural, behavioral, cognitive, and physiological health of adversity-exposed infants and adolescents. Prior to her studies at UD, Marta received her master's degrees at the [University of Szeged, Hungary](https://u-szeged.hu/english) in 2015 in Clinical and Health Psychology and in Personality and Psychopathology at [Teachers College, Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/counseling-and-clinical-psychology/clinical/degrees--requirements/psychology-in-education-general-track-ma/) in 2018. During her studies at Columbia, Marta worked in Dr. Nim Tottenham's lab, studying the effects of early severe neglect on children's brain development.

She is currently a post-doctoral fellow at the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/research-areas/clinics-and-labs/edb/sdan), mentored by Dr. Katharina Kircanski and Dr. Daniel Pine. At NIMH, she studies the effects of the Unified Protocol on the brain development of depressed adolescents. Marta uses structural and functional MRI, EEG, hormonal assays, and behavioral methods with the ultimate goal to better understand mechanisms of therapeutic change.
